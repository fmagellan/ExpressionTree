# ExpressionTree
I followed Design patterns course by Professor Douglas C. Schmidt(@douglascraigschmidt), on youtube.
Instead of simply cloning the repository, I decided to write the whole program from the scratch.
Ofcourse, I will try follow his repository, once in a while, when I am lost.
But, I will do my best to implement it by myself.
Let's see how long this will take !
